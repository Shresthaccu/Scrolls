# Scrolls

A website to host literary works, classics as well as user submissions.

## Features

- Intuitive User Interface
- Ease and comfort of reading(Light/Dark/Custom Background)
- Options to sort by popularity, time of submission, genre, etc.
- Automatic assignment of genre and differentiation between prose and poetry through AI
- User specific suggestions based on likes given and time spent reading different materials
- Filter of inappropriate content based on user preference, auto-checking for age appropriateness
- News feed summarising articles from different news outlets along with links to said articles

## Road map

1. We will create an AI model for genre, targeted age group, and author identification.
2. We will create a system for user profiles. The reading preferences of the user would be assessed through their age, the posts they like, and time spent reading different genres/authors.
3. A basic text editor will be created where authors can write, edit and preview their work before submission.
4. The news feed will be created next. Articles from various news outlets will be summarised and shown based on most recent and important events.
